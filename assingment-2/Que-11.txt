Que.-> How to center block elements using CSS1?

Ans.-> CSS1 (the first version of CSS) doesn't provide a specific property for centering block elements. However, there are some techniques you can use to achieve centering. Here are a couple of methods:

1.Auto Margins:
Use the margin property with auto values on left and right sides. This works if the width of the block element is less than the width of its containing element.
Example:
.center-block {
    width: 50%; /* Adjust the width as needed */
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}

2.Text-Align and Centering as Inline Block:
If the block element is an inline-block or inline-level element, you can use the text-align property on the parent element and set text-align: center. This will center the inline-level elements inside.
Example:
.parent-container {
    text-align: center;
}

.center-block {
    display: inline-block;
    /* Additional styles for the block element */
}
