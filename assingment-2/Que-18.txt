Que.-> What are the media types allowed by CSS?

Ans.-> CSS allows you to specify different styles for different media types, allowing your styles to adapt to different output devices. The media attribute is used in the <link> and @import rules to specify the media type for which the styles are intended. Here are some common media types:

1.All (all): The default media type. Styles apply to all devices.
Example:
@media all {
    /* Styles for all devices */
}

2.Print (print): Styles for printed pages.
Example:
@media print {
    /* Styles for printed pages */
}

3.Screen (screen): Styles for screens, such as computer monitors and mobiles.
Example:
@media screen {
    /* Styles for screens */
}

4.Speech (speech): Styles for screen readers that convert text to speech.
Example:
@media speech {
    /* Styles for speech output */
}
